For example:\nNi amerikanoa naiz = I am American\nNi mexicanoa naiz = I am Mexican\nNi Euskalduna naiz = I am Basque\nYou can then combine the two sentences using the word ‘eta’, meaning ‘and’:\nNi Sean naiz, eta amerikanoa naiz\nNow you know all you need to make a basic introduction in Basque. Eskerrik Asko!"
