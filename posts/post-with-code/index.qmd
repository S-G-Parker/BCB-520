Introduce Yourself in Basque!

![Basque Flag](Basque Flag.png)

## Zure Izena (Your Name)

To tell someone your name in Basque, you need to know 3 simple words:

Ni (pronounced like 'knee') = I (Pronouns are not mandatory in Basque, but let's start out by using them)

(Your Name) = Your name, which I hope you already know

Naiz (pronounced like 'nice') = I am

In Basque, verbs always come after nouns and objects, so putting it all together we get:

Ni (your name) naiz

## Zure Nazionalitatea (Your Nationality)

You can also tell someone your nationality using the same sentence structure, substituting your nationality for your name. For example:

Ni amerikanoa naiz = I am American

Ni mexicanoa naiz = I am Mexican

Ni Euskalduna naiz = I am Basque

You can then combine the two sentences using the word 'eta', meaning 'and':

Ni Sean naiz, eta amerikanoa naiz

Now you know all you need to make a basic introduction in Basque. Eskerrik Asko!
